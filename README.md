# Treponema_mapping

First run data_sort.py on 
  1) a meta excel file with a [Sample] and [Health_Status] column
  2) an data excel file formated with sample names [Sample] going down column 1 and gene names going across row one showing reads per gene per sample
This code with create a new workbook, with each several sheets
  1) Full_Data: the complete list of samples and genes with an added Health_Status column
  2) A sheet for each health status, with all genes across the top row and only samples with that health status going down the first column  
     Note: May have to edit mappable health statuses  
     Current mappings are:  
            "Healthy": "Healthy"  
            "Diseased, Stable": "Stable PD"  
            "Diseased; Stable": "Stable PD"  
            "Diseased, Progressing": "Progressing PD"  
            "Diseased; Progressing": "Progressing PD"  
            "Diseased; Fluctuant": "Fluctuating PD"  
            "Diseased; Fluctuating": "Fluctuating PD"  
            "Diseased": "PD"  
     3) 3 rows at the bottom of each sheet for  
          1) The number of samples positive for that gene (row title includes total number of samples in that health status)
          2) Amount of samples positive for that gene as a percent
          3) Average number of reads for each gene  
          4) Average standard deviation for each gene  

     After code finishes running, open the new workbook, save, and close workbook. If you skip this, the next code won't work.  

     Then run summarize_data.py  
     This code will ask you to select a workbook (the sheet generated by data_sort.py) and add a new [Summary] sheet with two tables  
       1) Overall summary, per health status, number of samples positive for each gene, average number of reads per gene, average SD per gene (so the last 3 columns of each health status sheet in one table)  
       2) A distrubution table of the number of genes that were detected in a given range of samples. Ex: for row '(0,5]' and column 'Healthy' with a value of 945 means that 954 genes were detected in more than 0% but less than 5% of samples
